A\nnumber of stakeholders are part of that community. There are ongoing\ndiscussions in the Privacy CG. Interested parties are encouraged to engage with\nthe proposal <a href=\"https://github.com/privacycg/proposals/issues/10/\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Additionally, GPC is currently being implemented across the web. A number of\nbrowsers, extensions, and publishers are supporting or implementing GPC (see\nbelow).</p>\n"},{"key":"Benefit","data":{"title":"How does GPC benefit consumers, publishers, software makers, and advertisers?"},"html":"<p>The online advertising ecosystem is evolving, and consumer expectations are\nchanging. An increasing number of web users do not want to be tracked by parties\nthey aren’t choosing to interact with, and new laws, technological changes, and\nadvertising business models reflect these preferences.</p>\n<p>GPC provides consumers and businesses with clear expectations and guidelines for\nthe sharing and sale of data online. It permits users to easily and clearly\nexercise their privacy rights, facilitates greater trust between businesses and\ntheir customers, and fosters certainty for businesses and advertisers by relying\non an open standard.</p>\n"},{"key":"IsItBinding","data":{"title":"Is GPC legally binding?"},"html":"<p>GPC is intended to serve as an expression of users’ intent to\ninvoke their online privacy rights. Depending on the jurisdiction\nand applicable laws, a user’s expression through GPC may have\nlegal impact. However, GPC on its own does not create any\nlegally binding obligations.</p>\n<p>GPC may impact existing law in several ways: In California, Section 1798.135(c)\nof the <a href=\"http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?division=3.&#x26;part=4.&#x26;lawCode=CIV&#x26;title=1.81.5\">California Consumer Privacy Act\n(CCPA)</a>\ngives users the right to opt out of the sale of their personal information.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, Section 999.315 of the <a href=\"https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa/regs\">CCPA\nRegulations</a> requires businesses to honor\nthese opt-out requests. The regulations specify that \"[a] business shall provide\ntwo or more designated methods for submitting requests to opt-out […]\n[including] user-enabled global privacy controls, such as a browser plug-in or\nprivacy setting, device setting, or other mechanism, that communicate or signal\nthe consumer’s choice to opt-out of the sale of their personal information. […]\nUser-enabled global privacy controls, such as a browser plug-in or privacy\nsetting, device setting, or other mechanism, that communicate or signal the\nconsumer’s choice to opt-out of the sale of their personal information shall be\nconsidered a request directly from the consumer, not through an authorized\nagent.\"</p>\n<p>On this basis, it is possible that the GPC may become a legally binding opt-out\nsignal in California.</p>\n<p>In addition, the <a href=\"https://gdpr-info.eu/\">European General Data Protection Regulation\n(GDPR)</a> gives users the right to object to their personal\ndata being processed. The GPC signal is intended to convey a general request\nthat data controllers limit the sale or sharing of the user's personal data to\nother data controllers. It is possible that a GPC signal opting out of\nprocessing could create a legally binding obligation for data processors.</p>\n<p>In Bermuda, the Privacy Commissioner has\n<a href=\"https://www.privacy.bm/post/global-privacy-control-interoperability-in-action\">indicated</a>\nthat he believes the GPC may be used to create a legally binding obligation on\nbusinesses under their laws, which provide users the right to “request an\norganisation to cease, or not begin, using his [or her] personal information\n[…] for the purposes of advertising, marketing or public relations,” or\n“where the use of that personal information is causing or is likely to cause\nsubstantial damage or substantial distress to the individual or to another\nindividual.”</p>\n<p>Additional information is available in the <a href=\"https://privacycg.github.io/gpc-spec/\">proposed\nspecification</a>.</p>\n"},{"key":"DND","data":{"title":"Why not just use Do Not Track (DNT)?"},"html":"<p>Do Not Track was an effort preceding GPC to permit users to communicate their\nprivacy preferences to websites they visit. Unfortunately, in the appendices to\ntheir Final Statement of Reasons, the California Attorney General (AG)\ndetermined that the AG could not require businesses to comply with DNT requests\nbecause the requests do not clearly convey users’ intent to opt out of the sale\nof their data. A more detailed discussion of the inadequacies of DNT is\navailable as <a href=\"https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa/regs\">Appendix E</a> of\nthe AG’s Final Statement of Reasons.</p>\n<p>When considering whether DNT was sufficient under the CCPA, the AG specifically\ndetermined that a new type of privacy signal would benefit users and businesses\nand that its regulation is “intended to support innovation for privacy services\nthat facilitate the exercise of consumer rights in furtherance of the CCPA.”</p>\n<p>GPC responds to this call for innovation by providing a mechanism for privacy\nsignaling that is applicable to current laws, technologies, and business\npractices. The Attorney General has said that he believes GPC is “a technical\nstandard that would make it easier for consumers to stop the sale of their\npersonal information” and that he is\n“<a href=\"https://twitter.com/AGBecerra/status/1313884769478828032?s=20\">heartened</a> to\nsee a wave of innovation in this space.”</p>\n"},{"key":"ExistingDNS","data":{"title":"How does GPC interact with companies' existing Do Not Sell links?"},"html":"<p>The California AG has determined that businesses must honor two methods of\nsubmitting opt-outs. GPC is meant to provide users with an additional option\nfor objecting to the sale of their data, and it functions identically to\nclicking a “Do Not Sell My Personal Information” link provided by a business.</p>\n"},{"key":"Conflict","data":{"title":"What if there is a conflict between a GPC signal and a user-selected privacy preference?"},"html":"<p>Some jurisdictions allow businesses to sell user data when there is a conflict\nbetween global and site-specific preferences — for instance, if a user has\nprovided specific permission to a website to sell their data. The <a href=\"https://privacycg.github.io/gpc-spec/#bib-ccpa-regulations\">CCPA\nRegulations</a>\n§999.315(c)(2) state that when a GPC signal conflicts with the existing privacy\nsettings a consumer has with the business, the business shall respect the GPC\nsignal but may notify the consumer of the conflict and give the consumer an\nopportunity to confirm the business-specific privacy setting or participation in\na financial incentive program.</p>\n<p>A conflict between GPC and site-specific privacy preferences may be resolved\ndifferently in other jurisdictions.</p>\n<p>Additionally, some implementations of GPC allow users to consent to the sale or\nsharing of their data on an individual basis.</p>\n"},{"key":"Default","data":{"title":"Can GPC be enabled by default?"},"html":"<p>The GPC preference expression should accurately reflect the users’ privacy\npreferences. The threshold for obtaining user consent differs between\njurisdictions. GPC strives to honor those differences while still providing\nusers with choice about how businesses use their data. In some jurisdictions,\nthe presence of GPC in a user’s browser may constitute an adequate signal to not\nsell their data, while regulations in another jurisdiction may require the\nuser’s explicit consent in order to send a GPC signal.</p>\n<p>What constitutes a deliberate choice may differ between regional\nregulations. For example, regulations in one jurisdiction may consider the use\nof a privacy-focused browser to imply a GPC preference, such as under the CCPA\n<a href=\"https://oag.ca.gov/sites/all/files/agweb/pdfs/privacy/ccpa-fsor-appendix-e.pdf\">Final Statement of Reasons - Appendix E\n#73</a>\n(\"<em>The consumer exercises their choice by affirmatively choosing the privacy\ncontrol […] including when utilizing privacy-by-design products or\nservices</em>\"), while regulations in another jurisdiction may require explicit\nconsent from the user to send a GPC signal.</p>\n"}]},"__N_SSG":true}
